This project is based on making an analog clock.

We will use degree rotation for moving hour,minute and seconds hand with respect to change in time.

for hours hand
12hr = 360 degree
1hr = 30 degree
for h hours = 30*h degrees
The increase in minutes will also effect the movement of hours hand.so,
60min = 30 degree
1min = 1/2 degrees
for m minutes = m/2 degrees
The change of seconds will be negligible for hours hand
final formula for hours hand = 30*h + m/2
 
for minutes hand
60 minutes = 360 degrees
1min = 6 degrees
for m minutes = 6*m degrees

for seconds hand
60 seconds = 360 degree
s seconds = 6*s degrees

we used transform property to rotate hours,minutes and seconds hand with change in time.
